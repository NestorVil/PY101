# Alyssa was asked to write an implementation of a rolling buffer. You can add and remove 
# elements from a rolling buffer. However, once the buffer becomes full, any new elements 
# will displace the oldest elements in the buffer.

# She wrote two implementations of the code for adding elements to the buffer:

def add_to_rolling_buffer1(buffer, max_buffer_size, new_element):
    buffer.append(new_element)
    if len(buffer) > max_buffer_size:
        buffer.pop(0)
    return buffer

def add_to_rolling_buffer2(buffer, max_buffer_size, new_element):
    buffer = buffer + [new_element]
    if len(buffer) > max_buffer_size:
        buffer.pop(0)
    return buffer


# What is the key difference between these implementations?
# the first function mutates buffer with .append while the second does not and just creates a new list



# Yes, there is a difference. The first function (add_to_rolling_buffer1) mutates the original list 
# represented by buffer. The second function (add_to_rolling_buffer2) does not mutate the original list, 
# but instead creates a new list and assigns it to buffer, whose value ultimately gets returned by the function.
