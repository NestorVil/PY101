# Consider these two simple functions:

def foo(param="no"):
    return "yes"

def bar(param="no"):
    return (param == "no") and (foo() or "no")
            # False          and  (yes   or no)
# What will the following function invocation return?

bar(foo())

# It will return False. 

# When bar(foo()) is called, the foo function is executed first, returning "yes". This return value ("yes") 
# is then passed as the argument to the bar function. In bar, the parameter param is now "yes". 
# The expression (param == "no") and (foo() or "no") is evaluated as follows:

# param == "no" evaluates to False since param is "yes".
# Due to the and operator, (foo() or "no") is not executed since the first part of the and expression is already False.
# Since the left side of the and is False, Python returns False.
